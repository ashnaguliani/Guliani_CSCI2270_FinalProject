# Guliani_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI 2270 Spring 2016


Project	Summary

This code was built as part of a Final Project for CSCI 2270 - Data Structures. The program uses a linked list to create a league standings of the English Premier League, which is the English soccer league. The program can display different types of tables based on the current 2016 EPL teams, add scores of a game between any 2 teams, add teams, and delete teams. When a game score is entered, the winning team receives 3 points and the losing team receives 0 points and each team's number of games played increases by 1. If the teams tie, each team receives 1 point and another game played. When a new score is added, the program rearranges the linked list so teams are re-ordered by points. 

How to Run:

This code was built and compiled in CodeBlocks, which is the best way to run it. Once the main, cpp, & h files have been downloaded and brought into the CodeBlocks environment, they the build & run button will run the code. If you need to download the files individually,  the class was created without arguments. Everything in the code works through user input of numbers & team names. The team names need to be spelled correctly, so a quick look at the table (which is printed when it is built) before inputting a name should be beneficial.
